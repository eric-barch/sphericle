## Use Case

Online geography quizzes like [Seterra](https://www.geoguessr.com/vgp/3355), [playGeography](https://www.playgeography.com/), and [Geography.Games](https://geography.games/) are a great way to learn the geography of our world, but you're limited to studying _their_ quizzes.

What if you're an intrepid mountaineer, whose very survival depends on knowing every peak and pass in a particular mountain range? Or a budding sommelier, whose career rests on the ability to distinguish between the wine regions of Bordeaux and Burgundy? Maybe you're just an average person with a not-so-average enthusiasm for geographic trivia.

Whatever your background, geography apps with curated quizzes will never have the exact quiz you need to study a niche part of the world. Sphericle lets you make your own quizzes out of [OpenStreetMap](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/ui/search.html) and [Google Places](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview) locations. Once you've made your ideal quiz, you can save it, share it, and study it whenever you want.
